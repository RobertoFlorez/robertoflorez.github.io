I am an M.Sc Physics student at the University of Stuttgart, member of the International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Condensed Matter Science. I am currently working at the Fraunhofer IPA at the intersection between Quantum Computing (Numerical/Theory) and Machine Learning (Kernel Methods).
